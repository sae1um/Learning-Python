==== Things that I need to learn ====

-   Classes and OOP
    -   Attributes
    -   Constructors
    -   **init**
-   Lists and 2D Arrays
-   Control Flow
    -   if, else, for, while
    -   break and continue
-   Recursion
    -   DFS/backtracking for maze generation
    -   Base case and recursive call
-   Stack/Queue
    -   Lists for stacks
    -   Using collections.deque for queues (BFS)
-   Randomness
-   File I/O & JSON
-   GUIS
    -   Pygame
    -   Tkinter
    -   Event Loop

==== DSA CONCEPTS ====

-   Graph representation: Maze cells can be treated as nodes, walls as blocked edges
-   DFS (Depth First Search): Recursive maze carving / maze solving
-   BFS (Breadth First Search): Optional for shortest path solving
-   Stack: Can implement DFS iteratively
-   Union-Find: For Kruskal’s algorithm (optional advanced maze generation)
-   2D grid traversal: Visiting neighbors, checking bounds, marking visited

====Suggested Learning Path as a Beginner ====

Python Basics: variables, loops, lists, functions
OOP: classes, objects, methods, attributes
Recursion: simple examples like factorial, Fibonacci, then DFS
2D arrays & grid traversal: navigating neighbors
Random module: generating random choices for maze paths
Stack/Queue: using lists or collections.deque
JSON & File I/O: save/load maze
Pygame Basics: draw rectangles, update display, event loop
Optional: BFS, Kruskal’s/Prim’s algorithms, Pillow for image export
